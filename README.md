# JLCPCB Basic Library Resources

The [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) Basic Library of SMT parts for their [SMT Assembly service](https://jlcpcb.com/smt-assembly) is hard to find in English. Here are some resources.

## JLCPCB Sources

* Undocumented [link to xls file of all JLCPCB components with library type information](https://jlcpcb.com/video/jlcsmt_parts_library.xls).
* The [Chinese language version of the JLCPCB website](https://www.sz-jlc.com/portal/smtComponentList.html) is more feature complete than the English language version. You can sort by library type (Basic or Extended).

## Third Party

* An [interactive parametric search tool for the patrs available for the SMT assembly service](https://yaqwsx.github.io/jlcparts/) - running in a browser, updated daily
* A [complete list of the parts available for the SMT assembly service in CSV format here](https://github.com/NiklasFauth/jlcsmt-kicad-converter) with a Python script to match your BOM to JLCPCB parts. (Not just the Basic parts.)
* The JLCPCB / LCSC [parts symbol and footprint library](https://gitee.com/JLC_SMT/JLCSMT_LIB.git).
* The ["Basic" library in human-readable form](BasicLibrary.md) (this repo)
* The [CSV version](JLCPCB%20Basic%20SMT%20Components.csv) of the "Basic" library. (This repo. Data sourced on October 22, 2019.)
